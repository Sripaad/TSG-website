<h2>What is an e-commerce site?</h2>



<p>An e-commerce site is a collection of products. To be successful, build a site people want to buy from. Set up your store in a way so you can track your sales and discover where you’re losing sales from the backend. This way you can plug leaks in your conversion funnel. There are many platforms like Woocommerce or Shopify that can help you list products, track sales and understand how people are behaving on your site. </p>



<p>You can also sell on marketplaces. As a seller, many try to go with a marketplace like Amazon, eBay, or Walmart. Amazon is a goldmine for many brands. Amazon offers the perfect spot to get your products in front of a huge, engaged, and profitable audience. But before you set your store up, you need to know several things.</p>



<h2>What’s the difference between selling on Amazon and selling on your own site?</h2>



<p>Amazon has buyers who want to buy stuff. You don’t have to work to generate buyers. </p>



<p>But if those marketplaces are too overwhelming or too expensive for you, you might want to look towards a marketplace that is more niche. That requires some research on your part.</p>



<p>That means you’ll need to compete with a lot fewer sellers. Wherever you choose to sell products the next strategies can help you sell more. </p>



<h2 class="borderhead">Ecommerce Marketing Strategies 2020</h2>



<p></p>



<h3>Strategy 1: Determine the niche </h3>



<p>The first step in this process is to identify the niche you want to focus on. Electronics, car sales, and even home improvement—the number of options is endless. Start by thinking about your ideal customer. What are they looking for? What are the types of products they want? Are they interested in DIY or getting ready-made products? </p>



<p>You might be selling a fitness product, for example. Or you might couple selling health supplements with the fitness product after listening to customer feedback. Make sure you’re thinking about it with an angle concerning your business strategy. You might be tempted to sell everything like Amazon does. </p>



<p>Amazon now sells almost everything under the sun with product categories stretching across a dizzying vast number of verticals. But when they started, they sold books. Their presence was so tiny that big bookstores laughed at them. It’s alright for you to start small. Start with a problem you’re facing. Solve it for others. Or you could start with your passions and validate the niche idea with keyword research. Here’s how I researched a sample niche.</p>



<p>I started with “dog collar”. The competition is fierce.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/dog-collar.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>So I thought of alternatives and thankfully arrived at small dog collars.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/keyword-ideas.png" alt=""/></figure>



<h3>Strategy 2: Research audience demographics and device types</h3>



<p>Next, determine where your target market resides. Is your target market primarily in the U.S.?</p>



<p>Next, imagine your target market using different types of devices. It could be through a smartphone, a tablet, or even home assistant devices. Does your audience like textual content, podcasts or videos? Almost <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/video-marketing-statistics-for-2020-infographic/566099/" target="_blank">half the online population</a> watches a video every day.</p>



<p>This is where you want to get super-specific. You want to market your products through apps and devices to people who use different types of devices. If you’re not sure, run competitor sites through Alexa.com. They generate accurate user demographics.</p>



<h3>Strategy 3: Sketch a buyer persona</h3>



<p>Ultimately with demographic data and device usage data what you’re trying to build is a buyer persona.</p>



<p>A buyer persona is a description of your ideal customer. It tells you who they are, what they are interested in, what problems they face, how they think, and what they would like to see on your site.</p>



<p>Buyer personas are great for driving traffic to your eCommerce store. They are specific to your business.  With the above factors, you’ll have a good idea of the broad pointers that make up your customers’ characteristics.</p>



<p>If that isn’t enough, get on the phone with some of your customers to get a deeper idea.</p>



<h3>Strategy 4: Create a unique value proposition </h3>



<p>You’ll need to do a little market research. The key here is to know what makes your product or service unique. What does your target market need? What do they prefer? What’s the most appealing feature that could appeal to them?</p>



<p>When you’re thinking about your product, you want to find out the type of people who would buy it and how you can possibly appeal to them. This is called market research, and it will help you get to the bottom of this. </p>



<p>If you want to get more specific, you can visit different Facebook pages or websites to see what people are saying. You might be able to find out what’s pre-existing and what’s new. You can also use keyword research, which will allow you to discover how many search for a particular product or keywords around it. Ultimately, the goal is to create a unique value proposition that defines your brand. </p>



<p>One example is Anthony’s Goods. </p>



<p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1003015271" target="_blank">Anthony got the idea</a> to sell almond flour and other gluten-free products after doctors gave him a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Once he skipped wheat flour he started feeling better. For Anthony’s special dietary requirements, alternative flours were hard to come by. So Anthony decided to solve his own problem by reaching out to select few who made good gluten-free flour. Next, with this friend Alex, he started the business on Amazon. The first month he sold 10 packets. And a year later the numbers swelled to 500 and a few thousand after. Anthony feels that Amazon has been a life-changing decision. </p>



<p>The platform gives him access to customers. Unlike retail stores, he doesn’t have to fight for shelf space. The playing field is level and no one looks down at you because you’re new. You’re are not made to feel small because you’re a startup. The only caveat? The product should be stellar. And the customer has to know it. Anthony not only sells on Amazon but also on his website. For him, the unique value proposition is quality gluten-free flours and products.</p>



<p>Even the packaging looks organic. If you want to communicate your value proposition effectively you must sport quality <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/ecommerce-website-development/">eCommerce website design</a>.</p>



<h3>Strategy 5: Improve the user experience </h3>



<p>With the competition on a massive scale- Amazon, eBay, and Walmart have become the behemoths of eCommerce. When they’re not competing on price, they’re busy competing on user experience. They know how to build a user-friendly interface that keeps customers on the site and turning them into return shoppers.</p>



<p>That means you need to create a very simple e-commerce website that’s easy to navigate and load quickly. It needs to look good, sure, but it needs to do more than that. </p>



<p>A lot of sites change their site design around the time of Christmas or other holidays. This is done to <a href="https://crello.com/blog/5-brilliant-ideas-for-christmas-social-media-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">imbue the holiday spirit</a>, improve user experience and generate more sales.</p>



<p>One of the easiest ways to do that is to optimize your site by listening to customer feedback</p>



<h3>Strategy 6: Set up an affiliate program</h3>



<p>There are lots of affiliate management programs out there, but an affiliate program is one of the best. </p>



<p>Affiliate marketing relies on user-generated content. This content comes from third-parties who stand to receive a commission for each product sold. A website that drives referral traffic and sales to your site will earn a commission from you. That’s how affiliate programs work.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, take the time to set up your program. Have a dedicated landing page for your affiliate program from DepositPhotos.</p>



<p>Here’s what it will look like.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/depositphotospartner.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>First, you’ll need to set up the rules. This is where you’ll decide how to set certain conditions and conditions for your program.</p>



<p>You’ll want to set these conditions first so that you can get a good feel for the type of affiliate program terms you’ll be working with.</p>



<h3>Strategy 7: Use Pinterest </h3>



<p>Pinterest is a highly visual platform. This makes it superior to Facebook, Twitter and other social media networks for eCommerce marketers. You can drive engaged traffic with the platform. How? Just think about it this way. Most e-commerce platforms give their users the option to pin products to boards or add items to the product board. This feature is either built-in or achieved through plugins.</p>



<p>Buyable Pins are pinned to the top of the board. And a visitor clicking on it gets a link to purchase the product. That way, users don’t have to go on a product research spree. Again, when using buyable pins, make it easy for your followers. Include a description and the price of the product in your description. This means users don’t have to dig around to get more information and can make the decision right there. Show the price of the product whenever possible. Without a description and price, you will still get link clicks but a description supplemented with pricing takes users close to the conversion. This makes things easy for your customers. I know from experience that Buyable Pins are great for e-commerce stores. </p>



<h3>Strategy 8: Grow your brand with user-generated content </h3>



<p>User-generated content is one of the best ways to display the products of your site.</p>



<p>You may not have the biggest social following, but there’s no reason why you can’t use social proof to your advantage. Social proof is a way to show your customers how many other people are buying from your eCommerce store. You can use social proof in a variety of ways, including:</p>



<p>* Testimonials<br>
* Reviews from customers<br> 
* Customer logos
</p>



<p>Here’s an example. They not only include testimonials but user counts as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/testimonial-1-million-people.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A simple way to do this is to include a video testimonial on your product page. The idea is that people will read about the customer and see that others have bought the product as well. You can also include a product video to add to your product page.</p>



<p>With UGC content, you can add it to email campaigns to showcase social proof. Successful brands tie in social proof with their promotions email campaigns, on their websites and other places. This gets them more mileage for their social proof.</p>



<p>Each of these places is an opportunity to feature the product in a better spotlight. You can showcase videos that feature customers or showcase videos with the product in the context of how it&#8217;s used.</p>



<p>Customers showcasing proof of the product they&#8217;re using and the warning is a great example of social proof for your brand. Rent the Runway is an excellent example. </p>



<p>Rent the Runway lets customers rent out fashionable dresses that models wore on fashion runways. The brand found that a majority of customers had a great experience with these rented dresses and they captured these moments by uploading them to social media channels like Facebook. All in all, there were 12000 such photos. The startup then collected all these pictures, posting them to a single destination called Our Runway. This was user-generated content that provided social proof to this new concept of renting haute couture dresses. The marketing move was nothing short of genius. People who viewed these photos were 200% more likely to rent the clothes than those who didn’t. The platform established itself as a product for everyday women who want to wear amazing new styles. These pictures are more useful for customers who want to feel the product.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/runway.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The message is loud and clear. The apparel is for everyday people. The campaign allowed the brand to use the tons of user-generated content it already had. It’s ideal for eCommerce companies that sell physical products that customers can show in context. The company can sell the product and convey its benefits to the consumer and elevate the overall brand experience</p>



<p>Another example is GoPro that selects a “Photo of the Day” from the vast number of submissions its customers send them.</p>



<p>This encourages its customers to participate more and create more UGC for the brand.
Cadbury is doing the same thing with its Madbury campaign that invites casual browsers on social media to try their hand at chocolate making.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/dairymilk.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>At the end of the contest&#8211; a winner is chosen who’s recipe will turn into a new Cadbury bar. This provides people the incentive to participate in large numbers.</p>



<h3>9. SEO for eCommerce</h3>



<p>You can drive organic traffic to your store with the help of search engine optimization. If done right, the rewards are enormous. When starting with SEO take care that you don’t go for keywords that are too competitive. You’ll break the bank trying to rank for the said keyword. And there’s every possibility that you won’t rank for it either. That’s why keyword research is so important. Use it to find keywords that offer you the best shot at ranking well. That means selecting easy to rank keywords with low keyword difficulty scores.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/SEO-for-eCommerce-eCommerce-Marketing-Strategy-1024x432.png" alt="Use Amazon for Keyword research" class="wp-image-913" srcset="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/SEO-for-eCommerce-eCommerce-Marketing-Strategy-1024x432.png 1024w, https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/SEO-for-eCommerce-eCommerce-Marketing-Strategy-300x126.png 300w, https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/SEO-for-eCommerce-eCommerce-Marketing-Strategy-768x324.png 768w, https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/SEO-for-eCommerce-eCommerce-Marketing-Strategy.png 1139w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When running an eCommerce store, rather than using keyword research tools right off the bat, use Amazon to discover suggestions and matching queries and then feed those selections to keyword research tools. Next up is backlink building. It doesn’t matter how good your content is. You won’t get far without quality backlinks. You could try landing guest posts on niche relevant blogs or technology blogs that are somehow relevant to what you write about. If you’re doubtful hire an expert for <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/seo-services/seo-company-in-Singapore/">SEO services</a>.</p>



<p>There are several eCommerce sites I know of that ranked purely on the back of the guest posts they did. Plus great on-page SEO optimization.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts </h2>



<p>Build a brand that people want to buy from. Right now, more and more people are buying items online than from stores. And you need to be there at all the right places at the right time. And this is how you can be.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="useful-list-items">
<div>
<h2>1. Oswald / Quattrocento</h2>
<p>Oswald represents a genre of fonts that is simple by design yet elegant and classy in style. It is sharp, bold and intelligent and can make a grand impact in the minds of the readers. Quattrcento, on the other hand, is mild and a tad sober in outlook but displays details. This contrasting pair of fonts work well together and can relay the intended messages.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/Oswald-Quattrocento.jpg" alt="Oswald / Quattrocento">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Playfair Display / Libre Baskerville</h2>
<p>The characteristic contrasting delicate hairlines intermingled with bold streaks makes Playfair Display a font that stands out. The slight elongation makes Libre Baskerville a perfectly readable font when employed for body texts. The marriage between the two seemingly different font types is indeed a twisty love story that is truly astounding.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/PlayfairDisplay-LibreBaskerville.jpg" alt="Playfair Display / Libre Baskerville">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. Nixie One / Open Sans</h2>
<p>If you want something short and sweet occupying the headlines, you should give it to Nixie One. This font touted as a mixture between neon tubes and a typewriter brings us the memory of signage filled streets of Las Vegas and the good old typewriter. The not-so-contrasting sleek and simple Open Sans quite surprisingly goes well with Nixie One to pass as one of the neat font combos.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/Nixie-One-Open-Sans.jpg" alt="Nixie One / Open Sans">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Fjalla One / Nunito</h2>
<p>The wide range of sizes in which Fjalla One can be used shows the flexibility it displays. Contrast it with the flexibility of Nunito, a sans serif typeface font with its 14 different subtypes of varying weight. If simplicity is your mantra and you are looking to do up something simple yet eye-catching, this combo should work for you.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/FjallaOne-Nunito.jpg" alt="Fjalla One / Nunito">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Julius Sans One / Crimson Text</h2>
<p>A combination of looking chic and opulent at the same time characterizes Julius Sans One, a font belonging to the sans serif typeface font family. The uncomplicated Crimson Text resembles someone’s neat handwriting. The thin elegance of Julius Sans One find a match with plain Crimson Text and makes a silent pitch in the process.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/JuliusSansOne-CrimsonText.jpg" alt="Julius Sans One / Crimson Text">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>6. Alfa Slab One / Gentium Book Basic</h2>
<p>Look out of the window and check who the boss is. Say welcome to Alfa Slab One, a new definition to boldness. If you are looking for a font that resembles a sitting duck but is clear and readable, Gentium Book Basic is the one you should be rightly looking for. The bold statement made by the combination of the two fonts is sure to create a lasting impression in the reader&#8217;s mind.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/AlfaSlabOne-GentiumBookBasic.jpg" alt="Alfa Slab One / Gentium Book Basic">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>7. Mr De Haviland / Fauna One</h2>
<p>If you are looking for an elegant feminine touch to your caption, Mr De Haviland’s script type font should be your choice. The modern typeface of Fauna One with its softer and curved corner looks straight forward and as easy as pie. Should your text carry natural background imageries, these contrasting pair of fonts are sure to do well.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/MrDeHaviland-FaunaOne.jpg" alt="Mr De Haviland / Fauna One">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>8. Anton / Sintony</h2>
<p>Modern web browsers have a love for sans serif typefaces and among them Anton occupies the royal spot. The slightly square-shaped Sintony with its smoother strokes is pleasant to the reader’s eyes. A content box with a header text in Antony and the subtexts in Sintony rhymes well not only in sound but also to produce sound visual effects.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/Anton-Sintony.jpg" alt="Anton / Sintony">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>9. Muli / Playfair Display</h2>
<p>Muli is a two-in-one font which can be used as a display font and a text font too. The delicate hairlines intermingled with bold streaks of the Playfair Display rather brings in a degree of affability. The agreeability of Muli combines with the transitional character of Playfair Display to create friendly typography.</p>
<img class="blfonim" src="https://www.thesitegurus.com/img/Muli-PlayfairDisplay.jpg" alt="Muli / Playfair Display">

Slow website leads to increased bounce rate, drop in search engine rankings &#038; poor UX. WordPress is a great platform if you use it the right way. This guide on "Speeding up your WordPress Website" will help you optimise the most important factors slowing down your WordPress website.]]></description>

<div class="useful-list-items">
<h2 style="font-family:Unlock; margin-bottom:20px;">14 Tips to Speed up WordPress:</h2>
<div>
<h2>1. Run a PageSpeed test</h2>
<p><a target="blank" class="implink" href="https://gtmetrix.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">GTMetrix</a> &#038; <a target="blank" class="implink" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> are the most popular tools to test page speed of any website. Google PageSpeed Insights is my personal favourite. These tools will get you a detailed report on what issues you have to resolve to speed up your website.</p>
<img src="https://tsg.b-cdn.net/Run-a-PageSpeed-test.png" alt="WordPress Speed jumped 60% after optimisation - Tested with GTmetrix">
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Use a Custom WordPress theme</h2>
<p>More than 70% of WordPress websites are using pre-built templates from market places. Testing it with Google PageSpeed insights you will shock you! Mobile page speed score will be less than 50%. Thats because of tons of modules that comes as features which you will never use. Unless you use a good WordPress theme you will be landing in a no-mans land. It will be nightmare to optimise your WordPress website. So choose your WordPress theme wisely! I prefer a custom built theme. You will have complete control over the theme and optimise it for performance.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. Optimise Images</h2>
<p>You can compress and serve scaled images. I use compressjpeg.com to compress jpeg and compresspng.com to compress png. You can use modern day image formats like WebP, JPEG XR or JPEG 2000. You have to be aware of the fact browsers like Mozilla and Safari are not supporting WebP.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Merge JS &#038; CSS files</h2>
<p>Use fewer JS &#038; CSS files. Lesser the request will lead to better performance.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Defer blocking CSS &#038; JS</h2>
<p>Deferring blocking CSS &#038; JS files will allow the browser to print the page immediately. You can use defer attribute to defer your JS files and pass css path using JS after detecting page load.</p> 
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>6. Use CSS Image Sprites</h2>
<p>Using image sprites will reduce the number of requests your web page has. Combine social media icons and other icons into one image. This will show a drastic improvement in performance. We accomplished this in Dezvolta&#8217;s official website. We combined 30+ images into one image sprite reducing 29 extra requests.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>7. Use Lazy-load</h2>
<p>If your website has lots of images? Lazy load your images so your images will render only when the user scrolls to that section. You can see a jump in performance as soon as you use this technique. Refer this article on Google which explains how to <a target="blank" class="implink" href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/" rel="noopener noreferrer">lazy load images &#038; video.</a></p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>8. Enable Gzip &#038; Leverage browser caching</h2>
<p>Copy &#038; paste the following lines in your .htaccess file.  This will enable Gzip &#038; <a href="https://wpdatatables.com/leverage-browser-caching/" target="blank" class="implink"  rel="noopener noreferrer">leverage browser caching</a>.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Content Marketing plays a key role in marketing because it has the power to convert serious visitors as potential leads. Most businesses these days are slowly turning to content marketing because it not only brings in more business but also contributes to brand value. This trend is now common for both B2B and B2C companies because of the targeted reach a content marketing effort can accomplish.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="useful-list-items">
			<p>A growing number of organisations are increasingly looking to do effective content marketing to convert their visitors to leads. So organisations are now turning to outsource most of their content marketing requirements. This gives them time and resource advantages. If you are seriously thinking about how to double your conversion rate, the below-mentioned steps should take you to the next level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>1. Create Unique Content that Converts</h2>
<p>The content you create has to be unique and it should definitely stand out. This enables you to get more visitors to your site else it will get lost in the online world. You should create the right content which should ideally represent your brand. This creates a visible impact and can contribute indirectly to your brand building exercise. The content should also inspire people because you need to remember that the content can be shared by targeted people. You should do an in-depth analysis on what topic to choose that are related to your niche and can bring in more traffic. You should make sure to adopt and maintain the tone of the content till the end. This not only helps to bring a seamless flow in the content but also keeps your targeted audience read through the content entirely. The content, when written from an end user’s perspective with crisp information on your brand can help conversion. More importantly, when the intended audience perceives the content to be qualitative, as a parallel measure it creates a positive perception that you are an authority in the subject. The value they see in the content compels serious visitors to become your customers.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Make your Content Visually Appealing</h2>
<p>You should create content with an intention to attract the end users. Everyone loves videos. &nbsp;Short videos and pictorial representations of the products and services you offer fly more than text contents. The key is to keep your videos short and convey the intended message. You should take care not to give a promotional tone to your videos. Many research on consumer behavior point to the fact that people are not interested in knowing about products or services. Rather they are more interested in getting solutions. The interesting fact is every product and service is a solution to some nagging problem. For example, a tourism package is a solution to beat the stress.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. CTA Matters</h2>
<p>Call to Action strategy has a great impact when it comes to converting a visitor into a potential lead. Dynamic CTAs work well because it initiates the user the need to click and check your offerings. When your targeted audience has arrived at this point, the percentage of conversion is certainly higher. Additionally, they also help you track your efforts and better the conversion rate in the future when you run similar campaigns.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Be a Master Blogger and Stand out in the crowd</h2>
<p>Your presence in the entire blog network that concerns your niche is very important. This presence helps in establishing yourself as a thought leader in your niche. This might definitely pave the way to reach higher goals like appearing in talk shows, writing for popular magazines and e-magazines, etc. So make guest posting a strategy because it can help you in bringing more targeted visitors to your website. You should do this on a continuous basis by contributing guest posts regularly. This effort creates a consistency and gradually increases visibility. A good visibility creates brand value and you begin to be noticed. You should just keep writing and the results will start trickling in slowly but steadily.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Constantly Study your Customers Needs</h2>
<p>No marketers hate to double their conversion rate. One way to keep tab with your customer preferences is to occasionally get feedback from the customers. You can create a simple questionnaire to your targeted customers and ask them what they would like to see in your products or services. Based on the feedback received, you can then study the expectations and begin aligning your products and services to customer aka market expectations. If you have a content marketing team that is engaged in creating your content, you should brainstorm with them and evolve a strategy. So you should keep engaging your customers to keep yourself and the brand relevant.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If played wisely the aforementioned points on content marketing can help you leverage your marketing efforts and can increase your conversion rate.

				<description><![CDATA[Domain Name is the first best impression you make to your customers. Wise selection of Domain Name will last longer and stronger in the minds of people.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="useful-list-items">
<h2 style="font-family:Unlock; margin-bottom:20px;">9 Tips for choosing the best domain name:</h2>
<div>
<h2>1. Short and Catchy</h2>
<p>Having a short domain name is really helpful as it would be easy to spell and type. So, limit your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name" class="implink" target="_blank">domain name</a> to maximum of 10 – 12 characters. Famous brand like Google, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter are all short yet catchy. It’s great when name is less than 6 characters. Make it sound like a premium brand and a memorable one.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Avoid Keyword Stuffing</h2>
<p>Choose a domain name based on your business.<br>
E.g. Webdesigner.cheap has the keyword “web design” telling people that this website is all about <a class="implink" href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/web-design-services/">web design services</a>.<br>
Such inclusions helps a lot in SEO process. Search Engines crawl yours better than your peers.</p>
<p>The keyword should only be a part of your Domain Name and not be stuffed.<br>
E.g. www.bestwebdesigncompany.com, www.bestwebdevelopmentservices.com<br>
Here keyword “best web design company” is being stuffed which is obviously a bad practice.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. No non-alphabets</h2>
<p>Usage of numbers &amp; other characters like hyphen ( – ), and(&amp;) ,underscore ( _ ) should be avoided. These could mislead your visitors if mistyped.<br>
Better frame your Domain Name by only using alphabets. Also avoid misspelling.<br>
E.g. “u” for “you”, “4” for “for”. This misleads your visitors.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Make a list</h2>
<p>When you start naming do not check for Domain Name and purchase in the first go. Make a list. You may get better ideas when you think for longer time. There are some tools to generate Domain Names. You can use these tools and get more combination &amp; new ideas.<br>
Wordoid, Lean Domain Search and DomainHole are few tools. Be creative and think out of the box. You can even look for similar terms using thesaurus or even translate from different language.<br>
E.g. www.thesitegurus.com is a <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com" style="
    border-bottom: 1px solid;
">website development company</a>.<br>
“Dezvolta” is a Romanian word for “develop”. It means the business and also unique from its peers.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Availability Check</h2>
<p>Once you make a list, check for its availability. There is less chance for short &amp; easy domains. Even if your Domain Name is available, you need to confirm its space in social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.<br>
You can use tool like “knowem” to check social media account availability.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>6. Extension Research</h2>
<p>.com is the most famous of all extensions. You can choose your extension based on your purpose.<br>
E.g.<br>
1) .com stands for commercial<br>
2) .in for india – Location based<br>
3) .ca for canada – Location based<br>
4) .sg for singapore – Location based<br>
5) .org for Non-profit<br>
6) .net, info for information site<br>
7) .me for personal blog / portfolio<br>
8) .pro for professionals<br>
Recently many extensions like “ .site, .best “ are coming up.<br>
E.g. www.webdesigner.cheap where “cheap” extension clearly conveys that they offer <a href="https://webdesigner.cheap/" style="
    border-bottom: 1px solid;
">Affordable web design services</a>. Likewise, your extension conveys the type of the website.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>7. Legality Check</h2>
<p>It is the most important part in Domain Name. Check if the name chosen has been penalised by the search engine “Google”. There are possibilities for Domain Names to be penalised by Google for malpractice by spammers and once you buy it is really going to trouble you. You can confirm it using site:operator. And wayBack Machine helps you to find out what was the Domain Name previously used for. Whois.com is another such site gives you the information about the owners etc.<br>
Next important check is the TradeMark. Find out whether anyone has got the TM for your name. If so, it would create legal issues when used.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>8. Domain Acquisition</h2>
<p>Look for the names that was once used and is down now. You have added advantages on doing this. The Domain Name having good number of backlinks and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-metrics/#section10" class="implink" target="_blank">domain rating</a> (DR) is likely preferred for acquisition. You can easily redirect it to your current site. This increases your backlinks and DR.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>9. Buy Relevant Domains</h2>
<p>It is advisable to buy the other extensions of your Domain Name as well. As Domain Names are sold really fast, there is a chance for your competitor to acquire your Domain Name with different extension and act faster than you, messing up your situation. Moreover, buying misspelt version also helps your visitors redirected to your site avoiding distractions.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>Hope you enjoyed the 9 quality tips to choose a great domain name for your business.<br></p></div>

				<description><![CDATA[When a visitor lands on your website, there are so many things that they immediately take into account. Analytics confirm that you have less than a second to convert a visitor into a customer. Everything right from your design, font, color choices, content to usability will influence a person’s decision to stay on your page.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Web design plays an influential role in customer conversion rate and when some of these mistakes are made, they could inversely affect your brand’s reach and growth. This is what should be avoided when designing or revamping your website.</p><cite>&#8211; Dezvolta Team</cite></blockquote>



<div class="useful-list-items">
<div>
<h2>1. Old School Web Layouts Don’t Work</h2>
<p>Being ready to adopt change is important and customers get instantly turned off when they see a website that looks so nostalgic. Not in a good way because any design element or template could be considered retro in a matter of months or years in this fast-changing world. If you haven’t redesigned your existing website in the past 3-5 years, you are missing out on a large portion of your potential customers and it’s time to approach a reputed website design company.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Inconsistent, Random Design Elements Thrown In</h2>
<p>A seamless visual express is a key to attracting your visitors and converting them. The website’s layout, if it begins with bright, light colors and bold fonts, it should continue all over. Switching to a black and white tone or simply introducing too many images instead of content scream inconsistency. It forces users to feel alienated and abandon the page. Avoid it by keeping your web design consistent throughout the pages and offer a smooth wave-like experience for your visitors.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. Never Use Too Many Fonts on the Same Page</h2>
<p>Another common mistake that is sometimes triggered by sheer creativity is using too many fonts on the same page. Just imagine an amateurishly designed web page where you have used fonts like Georgia, Futura, and Helvetica to make an announcement, any average human will find it very difficult to understand the flow and the message inside it. A good design aesthetic is to go with a major font for the website combined with a secondary font. They should be web-friendly, look professional and set the tone for your business.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Infusing Many Colors at Once</h2>
<p>A strict no! Much similar to how using multiple fonts in a single page would affect the user’s capability to read and understand the content, too many shades of colors would make any new user find it tough to cope up with the layout. You can choose a color that is slightly similar to the shades used in your logo or go with completely contrasting colors than your logo to differentiate them on the website. Pick colors that pair with one another and maintain them throughout the website.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Inconsistent Spacing</h2>
<p>Follow the guidelines of design principle proximity when creating boxes, icons and placing headers. The content area and images should merge with one another with the right amount of spacing. If they are too tight, they look cramped and your customer conversion rate will get affected as they may choose to close the website. Similarly, large spaces could create emptiness on the website’s layout making it harder to follow what’s your primary objective is.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of many mistakes which when committed in website design could hurt your customer conversion rate. By fixing them all and working with a <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/web-design-services/">professional web design company</a> like <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/">Dezvolta</a>, you can get the best services possible while giving your business the boost it needs with attractive web design solutions.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Every designer will have a visionary idea, an entrepreneur would imagine their brand in a unique way while a content writer will play with words to entice your customers.]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="useful-list-items">
<blockquote><p>
The website that you are building right now is a conglomeration of every creative idea, every individual person in your team and at the end of the day, the big goal is to impress your audience somehow.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s when these 10 highly important elements come into the picture because whether you love it or not, your new website should have them all so that it is easier for a new visitor to navigate and understand the product being offered. These are ground rules to build a site and are followed globally as a minimal standard for web design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>1. Navigation – Keep it Simple</h2>
<p>Most people miss the fact that a new visitor feels alienated in a website if the navigation isn’t simple and easy to understand. Keep it simple, the navigational menus should be readily accessible and make sure they are not too many in number. You can go with a three or five-button navigation bar on top but keep it in the same location even when the bottom area of the website would keep changing.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Responsive Theme – Works Seamlessly on Any Device</h2>
<p>Choosing a great-looking theme is important but picking a responsive theme is mandatory. Users no longer browse websites on a desktop but they use smartphones and tablets. Keeping it more accessible, seamless and maintaining the design elements will ensure better conversion rates.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. An About Us Column – Introduce Yourself</h2>
<p>Personalization is everything! With hundreds of websites online, it’s integral to help your audience connect with your brand. An About Us column will help introduce yourself, share your views, dreams and what’s your ultimate goal. Keep the description simple, to the point and more personalized. It should do the trick!</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Call to Action – Trigger More Signups</h2>
<p>A website is the key to getting your potential customers onboard. The right web design can play magic in your visitor’s minds. Use flashy bright colors, try a unique font or use boxes, scroll animation to let them know it’s the place to sign up. Using a signup form is another way of converting visitors into customers. This is one of the important elements that you just can’t miss on your website.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Frequently Asked Questions – Answer Them Diligently</h2>
<p>The Frequently Asked Questions section, FAQs is there for a reason. Your visitor may have lots of unanswered questions, things they like to know before using your website. Be it a service provider, an e-commerce or a company website, all the basic questions should be answered diligently to gain that vote of confidence before they proceed to do business with you.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>6. Create a Contact Page – Just the Basics</h2>
<p>When people feel that you really have a presence and have an office established, it boosts the credibility factor. The contact page should provide the office address, different locations where your brand is located, vendors and locations marked on Google map.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>7. Try Personalized Photoshoots – Stock Photos are Fine</h2>
<p>Photographs are required to represent a product, community or the services you offer. Most websites use cheesy stock photos which you can avoid by hosting your own personalized photoshoots, if your budget permits. An alternative would be to use custom-made logos, icons and illustrations to convey the idea.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>8. Offer Informative Content – Build Credibility</h2>
<p>Give your visitors something that they might not immediately get from your competitors or any other site for that matter. Create white papers, eBooks or useful, informative guide on your primary area of expertise. It should help you acquire contact information like e-mail while building a credible brand name among your target audience.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>9. Stylish Buttons – Catchy Ones Work</h2>
<p>Whenever you use a button on your website, it should be easy to understand and immediately catch one’s attention. Make use of its prominence by using call to action words. Ask your users to sign up, download the software or offer free stuff through these catchy buttons that help grab their attention.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>10. Bullet Points – Easy to Read</h2>
<p>Bullet points are must-have elements on your new website because they help describe features, product highlights and are easy to read compared to long paragraphs. Design them in such a way that they instantly convey the message.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By striking a fine balance when using the right fonts, spacing, photos, responsive design, stylish buttons and other important web design elements in your website, you are on your way to build a strong patronage among visitors and effectively give your brand the winning edge against your competitors.</p>

<h2>4. Explore How They Merge Design with Content</h2>
<p>An impressive design combined with ease of usability and access is definitely the key to good web design but at the same time, the content should seamlessly merge with it. Talk to the design team to know what they think about content and how they can help implement it in a non-intrusive manner. They should have a clear idea that creative art is important but so is content! A website’s success is based on balancing and not simply focusing on art. Your company should know it.</p>

<h2>5. Responsive Design, CMS, SEO – Your Web Design Company Should Know It All</h2>
<p>Being a design-friendly place, the <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com" class="implink">web design company</a> you choose should also have ample knowledge in all technical aspects including content management system, search engine optimisation and should be able to create a responsive design.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Creativity abounds in the world of <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com/web-design-services/" style="
    border-bottom: 1px solid;
">web design</a> where evolution is constant. The designers are expected to be agile, willing to adopt change because in a highly competitive world, understanding the design language is integral to captivate the audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="font-family:Unlock; margin-bottom:20px;">Here is the Top Web Design Trends for 2019:</h2>
<div class="useful-list-items">
<div>
<h2>1. Gif Backgrounds – The Art of Using Moving Images</h2>
<p>A widely used design trend in 2019, gif backgrounds consist of a quick, endless video loop that has the capacity to instantly captivate the visitor’s attention. With millions of interesting and fun gifs available online these days, the web page could get a touch of finesse and get out of the conventional, boring layout that’s usually static.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>2. Linear Gradients – Apple Does it, So Can You!</h2>
<p>Saturated gradients were made popular by Apple in their official logo, iTunes and some of their promotional materials. With the right font and content, the vibrant colors are capable of grabbing attention instantaneously while being modern. After all, these originally originate from the retro 70s arcade era but with some tweaks can look as modern as it could get.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>3. Imagery – A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words</h2>
<p>Long gone are the days when websites used to be stuffed with words in every corner. A picture speaks better than a paragraph which is why <a href="https://www.thesitegurus.com" class="implink">web designers</a> are using large, descriptive images to get their marketing message across. They also help capture audience’s attention quickly and retain it.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>4. Multiple Colors Layered Together – Fashionista!!!</h2>
<p>Fashion websites and the related industry could do a lot by using multiple colored layers stacked up against one another. The design tends to convey lots of information at once and also makes it easy to differentiate between one website’s column from another. They may look more glossy but is a useful style for the right industry.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>5. Horizontal, Vertical – Brain Tease Your Audience</h2>
<p>What better way to brain tease your audience than using vertical and horizontal text messages? Inspired by the world of graffiti and street art, this trend is now slowly creeping into web design and just looks awesome when paired up with an appropriate image. Get your message across immediately by simply altering the position of the text.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>6. Overlapping – The Magazine Model</h2>
<p>Overlapping text over an image is something magazines have been doing for decades now but it’s a fairly new trend in web design 2019. A simple text, an artful image and captions could go well with one another. Using bold or italics is purely a personal choice as overlapping works perfectly fine with every style.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>7. Hand Drawn Graffiti Fonts – Get the Message Across</h2>
<p>Any website, like hosting an event, a party, announcing a big new show or being a rebel is best described with hand-drawn fonts. A wide range of hand-drawn graffiti styled fonts can be spotted online including those that are professional, wacky, child-like and much more styles to choose from.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>8. Circles, Colors and Materialism</h2>
<p>Microsoft made flat colors stylish again and Google’s Oreo made it popular. Now, designers can experiment with circles, flat colors and small fonts which can create the desired effect on your audience. While it’s primarily used in the world of technology, it could seamlessly blend with architecture, educational, food or any other commercial industry that wants to deliver a non-intrusive marketing message.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>9. Unconventional Typography – Experiment with Text</h2>
<p>Typography has always been a powerful tool for designers to make use of but with every font being redone so many times, it’s time to reinvent. A great example is using fonts over an image, overlapping with other text or placing them randomly in different places.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<h2>10. Playing with Shadows to Create Depth</h2>
<p>A less popular yet highly attractive way to showcase your products for an e-commerce website or any business site, shadows come in handy. They create a 3D version of the image, providing depth and make the design protrude out of the website. Definitely, a web design trend in 2019 that will flourish eventually.</p>
